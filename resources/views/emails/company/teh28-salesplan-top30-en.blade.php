# Hi {{ array_get($profile, "fname")  }},

As mentioned during the previous edition of the "Targi eHandlu" Trade Fair, we are implementing changes whose final effects will be visible during the **autumn edition of E-commerce Warsaw Expo – October 24, 2025, at EXPO XXI.**

The most significant change – from the Exhibitors’ perspective – seems to be the introduction of an entrance fee for visitors. Visitors will need to purchase a ticket either via our homepage or through an Exhibitor’s profile – in the latter case, by sharing their contact details, the ticket will be available at a discounted price (approx 7.00 EUR)

These changes are driven by our desire to increase exposure for international exhibitors and to professionalize the industry through more effective networking.

**Here is the plan for the launch of exhibitor space sales for E-commerce Warsaw Expo.**
