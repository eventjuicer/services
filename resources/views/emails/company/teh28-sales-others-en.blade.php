# Hi {{ array_get($profile, "fname")  }},

**You can now book an exhibition space for the upcoming Ecommerce Warsaw Expo** Autumn edition!

The date of the event: 24th of October 2025 (EXPO XXI Warsaw)

Visit [targiehandlu.pl/exhibit](https://targiehandlu.pl/exhibit) to check available booths, prices and reserve a space.

Some booths are already reserved by TOP30 of the Exhibitor's Contest (winners of the earlybird booking prize)



As mentioned during the previous edition of the "Targi eHandlu" Trade Fair, we are implementing changes whose final effects will be visible during the **autumn edition of E-commerce Warsaw Expo – October 24, 2025, at EXPO XXI.**

The most significant change – from the Exhibitors’ perspective – seems to be the introduction of an entrance fee for visitors. Visitors will need to purchase a ticket either via our homepage or through an Exhibitor’s profile – in the latter case, by sharing their contact details, the ticket will be available at a discounted price (approx 7.00 EUR).

These changes are driven by our desire to increase exposure for international exhibitors and to professionalize the industry through more effective networking.

 

Regards,
